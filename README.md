Answers to Questions 2 - 6

2. List five significant features of React.
   1. JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension
   2. Virtual DOM
   3. One-Way Data Binding
   4. Debugging
   5. Extensions
3. List five major advantages of React.
   1. It is easy to learn
   2. It makes it easier to create dynamic applications
   3. It has dedicated tools for easy debugging
   4. Reusable components
   5. Improved performance
4. What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Jordan Walke. Also, which company owns React? Meta (formerly Facebook)
5. What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
   1. In JSX, a single parent element (fragment) must be returned, or it won't compile. In HTML, on the other hand, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element
   2. While in HTML, the class attribute can be used on any HTML element, In JSX, the word class cannot be used to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className.
   3. In HTML almost all tags have an opening and a closing tag except probably a few while in JSX, any element can be written as a self-closing tag, for example: <div/>
6. Why can’t browsers read JSX? The browser does not understand JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code; there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
